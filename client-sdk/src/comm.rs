/// Sends a message and receives a response according to the protocol of the `comm` module of the SDK.
///
/// This function sends a message to a V-App and waits for a response.
/// The message is length-prefixed, then sent in chunks. After each chunk, an acknowledgment
/// message is expected from the V-App. If the acknowledgment is not received, an error is returned.
/// The response must start with a 4-byte length prefix, followed by the actual response data, which
/// is also split in chunks with the same approach.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `client` - The V-App client.
/// * `message` - A byte slice containing the message to be sent.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// A `Result` containing a vector of bytes representing the response data if successful, or a
/// `SendMessageError` if an error occurs during the communication protocol.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// This function will return a `SendMessageError` if:
///
/// * An acknowledgment (ACK) is expected but not received.
/// * The response length is less than 4 bytes.
/// * An error occurs during the execution of the virtual application client.
