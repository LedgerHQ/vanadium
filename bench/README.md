# Vanadium Benchmarks

This directory contains several benchmarks for the Vanadium VM. Each benchmark measures the performance of a specific operation or algorithm implemented for the Vanadium platform.

See the [tools/bench](../tools/bench) folder for more information on the benchmarks.

## Running the benchmarks

Install the `vnd-bench` tool from the [tools/bench](../tools/bench) folder first.

With the Vanadium app running on an unlocked Ledger device, run:

```sh
vnd-bench
```
