//! Module for sending and receiving messages using a custom protocol with alternating acknowledgments.
//!
//! This module provides an efficient way to handle message transmission between endpoints by using
//! length-prefix ed messages. This allows applications to use a fixed-length buffer for short messages,
//! reducing the need for large preallocated buffers. Large vectors are only allocated if necessary.
//!
//! The protocol alternates between sending and receiving chunks of data, ensuring reliable communication
//! through acknowledgment control. Each chunk sent or received is acknowledged by the other endpoint,
//! maintaining synchronization and error management throughout the transmission process.
//!
//! Key features of this module include:
//! - **Chunked Data Transmission**: Messages are divided into manageable chunks, allowing for efficient
//!   transmission and reception without requiring large buffers.
//! - **Length-Prefixing**: Messages are prefixed with their length, enabling dynamic buffer allocation
//!   only when necessary.
//!
//! Note: This module is not thread-safe. It is designed for single-threaded execution due to the use of
//! a static mutable buffer for chunk reuse.
